# Ishihara-test
Ishihara tests are used to detect red-green colour deficiency.

The code creates an Ishihara test plate, which consists of circles created by irregular coloured dots in two colours.
A colour blind person will not be able to distinguish between the red and green dots, thus seeing the circle as monochromatic.
